### Manual Provisioning for Cisco and 3rd Party/BYOD phones | RingCentral MVP

If your Cisco phone is not on the list of Certified and Supported Deskphones for RingCentral, you can configure your device via manual provisioning. The SIP settings are acquired from the RingCentral online account and entered manually into the corresponding provisioning fields in manual provisioning.

Note: 

RingCentral does not provide additional support for phones purchased from third-party vendors. For product support on devices not purchased from RingCentral, please refer to the product's vendor for support.

Some RingCentral deskphone features will not work on manually provisioned phones. It may vary depending on your deskphone model. 

Visit Manual Provisioning requirements for third-party (BYOD) deskphones to work with RingCentral to prepare your device before provisioning.
