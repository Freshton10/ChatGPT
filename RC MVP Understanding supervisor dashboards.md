3. Under Call details, click the Start Monitoring button.

5. A notification will indicate that you’re monitoring an active call, and will keep track of the duration of your monitoring session.
6. When you’re done, click Stop Monitoring.

**Barging in on a call**
1. You can barge in on or take control of a call if your agent needs assistance. You can also disconnect that agent or end the call for everyone.
2. In the left navigation bar, open the Supervisor menu.

4. Under Call details, click on the dropdown next to the Start Monitoring button, then select Barge-In.

6. The Barge-In popup window in the upper right-hand corner will display the agent’s name, the duration you’ve barged in on the call, the Hangup button, and an option to pause the agent or customer.
Note: If you click the Pause button, it will turn blue.

5. If you want to barge in on a call while you’re coaching, click the dropdown arrow on the Start Monitoring button, then select Barge-In.
6. If you want to disconnect from the call, click Stop Coaching on the popup.
