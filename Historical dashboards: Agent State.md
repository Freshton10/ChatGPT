### Historical dashboards: Agent State

The Engage platform provides several dashboards organized by categories that provide data on current information. Most of the reports used in dashboards can be found in the Standard folder of Historical reports.
Note: Dashboards and reports that reference digital data are reserved for future use.
Some parts of the UI will refer to reports as ‘insights.’ Reports are ‘insights’ as well. Still, most of the UI will only refer to reports as ‘reports’ and not ‘insights.’ Insight is a deprecated term.
The Agent State dashboard provides an overview of agent occupancy, and login utilization, as well as more detailed agent state statistics.

**Filters**
Date Range: A range of days that the dashboard will be covering. Preset to the last 30 days.
Account ID: The ID of the account that needs to be viewed.
Account: The sub-account to be reported on.
Agent Group: Narrows the report down to a subset of agent groups.
Agent Team: Narrows the report down to a subset of agent teams.
Agent Location: Narrows the report down to a subset of agent locations.
Agent Full Name: Narrows the report down to a subset of agents.
Note: An activity is attributed to a time interval by its start timestamp. The account filter is a parent filter to the other filters (except for the Date). For example, if you select a particular account, the Agent Group filter will be showing only agent groups of that account.

**Agent State KPIs section**
Voice Login Time Utilization: Percentage of the agent login time spent on calls.
Voice Agent Occupancy: Ratio or percentage of time an agent is engaged in calls to the time they are available.
Total Agent Login Time: Total time an agent is logged in.
Digital Login Time Utilization: Percentage of the agent login time spent on digital interactions.
Agent Digital Occupancy: Ratio or percentage of time an agent is engaged in digital interactions to the time they are available.

**Agent State Distributions section**
Voice Agent State Report: Pie chart that shows the voice agent’s state time broken up by base state.
Agent Digital State Chart: Pie chart that shows the digital agent’s state time broken up by digital state.

**Agent State Details section**
Contains the Agent Voice State Report, which shows a chart that gives the agent’s full name, base state, pending disposition time, other agent state time and the total agent state time (pending disposition time plus other agent state time) for voice agents.
