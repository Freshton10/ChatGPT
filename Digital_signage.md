###Setting up Digital Signage using RingCentral Rooms
**Creating dedicated Rooms for Digital Signage**
1. Sign in to your online account.
2. Go to **Meetings > RingCentral Video > Rooms > Rooms List**.
3. Click **Add Room**.
4. Select **Digital Signage Only** under **Room Type**.
5. Enter the Room name.
6. If you have a multi-site setting, select a location.
     (a). Note: If you have multiple office locations, we recommend creating a Room name or naming convention that makes it easier to select specific rooms. A typical naming convention might consist of, for instance, [Office Location] - [Conference Room Name]. For example: ‘SF - Ocean Beach,’ or ‘DEN - Breckenridge.’
7. Enter the URL you want to display on the monitor.
8. Click **Add**.
  [Note: Digital Signage Only rooms are only available for RingCentral brand users using Windows devices.]
