### Additional integration options

In addition to Salesforce, Contact Center customers can have our product integrated with our third-party applications. To access these integrations,t reach out to Contact Center’s professional services team, who will assist you in setting up the integration.
This article provides a high-level explanation of how additional integration options work when a customer request comes in.

**API applications**
Contact Center’s professional services utilize API applications to create custom frames for web pages. For example, our MAX agent application can be embedded in web pages using either contact panels or custom workspaces. Contact panels work well for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) web page that opens as a screen pop to a phone call. Custom workspaces work for knowledge base pages or other sites not directly associated with a contact or customer interaction (phone calls, chat messages, etc.).

**CRM integrations**
CRMs are third-party integrations that have no existing partnership with Contact Center. These types of integrations require custom work by our team, no matter which CRM it is. These non-standard integration modifications cannot occur until after the tool is live for the client.
Some CRMs our customers may request to integrate Contact Center with include:
Microsoft
ClearView
Shortel
Pipeline
Zendesk
