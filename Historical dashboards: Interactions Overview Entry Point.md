### Historical dashboards: Interactions Overview Entry Point

The Engage platform provides several dashboards organized by categories that provide data on current information. Most of the reports used in dashboards can be found in the Standard folder of Historical reports.
Note: Dashboards and reports that reference digital data are reserved for future use.
Some parts of the UI will refer to reports as ‘insights.’ Reports are ‘insights’ as well. Still, most of the UI will only refer to reports as ‘reports’ and not ‘insights.’ Insight is a deprecated term.
The Interactions Overview Entry Point dashboard helps customers navigate a set of interactions for analysis in the Interactions Overview dashboard. Selecting either a specific agent or an interaction's date, time, or unique ID will automatically redirect the user to the Interaction Overview dashboard, filtered for only the stats of the selected data points.

**Filters**
Date Range: A range of days that the dashboard will be covering. Preset to the last 90 days.
Account ID: The account ID that needs to be viewed.
Account: The account to be reported on.
Channel Type: Narrows the report to a specific channel type or a subset of channel types.
Product Group Type: Narrows reports to product groups (ex. Dial Group, IVR Group, etc.).
Product Group: Shows products by group name.
Product Type: Narrows the report to a specific product type.
Product: Displays product name.
UII Date: Displays the attribute for the date part of the UII (YYYYMMDD).
UII Time: Attribute for the time part of the UII (HHMMSS).
UID: Attribute for the last 16 digits of the UII (013VRU00000XXXXX).
Agent Full Name: Narrows the report to a subset of agents.
Agent ID: Displays by agent ID number.
Agent Group: Narrows the report to a subset of agent groups.
Agent Group ID: Displays by agent group ID number.
Agent Team: Displays agent teams.
Agent Location: Displays by agent location.
Note: An activity is attributed to a time interval by its start timestamp. The account filter is a parent filter to the other filters (except for the Date). For example, if you select a particular account, the Agent Group filter will show only agent groups of that account

**Drill to Agent**
This section contains a table that lists an agent’s full name. When clicked, this will drill down into the Interactions Overview dashboard  filtered to display only that agent’s stats.

**Drill to interaction**
This section contains four tables that list the UII Date, UII Time, UID, and the UII. Clicking on an attribute will drill down into the Interactions Overview dashboard filtered to display the attribute clicked and its related stats.
