### Cisco deskphones?

**Before provisioning your Cisco deskphone** 
1. Make sure your Cisco phone supports assisted provisioning. If your phone isn’t on the list, go to Manual provisioning for Cisco and third-party/BYOD phones to set it up.
2. Confirm your deskphone has been assigned a local number or DigitalLine.
3. If you purchased your deskphone from a different provider, check it’s unlocked before proceeding. You can contact the provider to learn if it’s unlocked or how to unlock it.

### Provisioning your Cisco deskphone

1. Go to the Admin Portal and sign in.
2. Select Phone System in the top menu.
3. Go to Phones & Devices > User Phones. Select the device with the DigitalLine or phone number you want to assign to your Cisco deskphone, then click the name in the Device column.
4. On the next screen, click Set Up and Provision. 
5. In the Setup & Provisioning window, enter the name of your Cisco deskphone, then select it from the dropdown. Then click Next.
6. Enter your phone’s IP address. Confirm the phone is connected to the same network as your computer. Click Next.
7. A popup window will show the progress as the phone reboots and provisions itself. You'll get a confirmation notice once the process is complete.
8. Click Done.
[Note: If the setup fails, access the phone's web interface by typing its IP address in your browser's address bar.]
1. Go to Admin Login > Advanced. Enter the phone's username and password.
-[If you haven’t updated the username and password, use the following:]
 -[▪ Username: admin]
 -[▪ Password: admin]
