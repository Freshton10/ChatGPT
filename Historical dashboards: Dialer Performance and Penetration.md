### Historical dashboards: Dialer Performance and Penetration

The Engage platform provides several dashboards organized by categories that provide data on current information. Most of the reports used in dashboards can be found in the Standard folder of Historical reports.
Note: Dashboards and reports that reference digital data are reserved for future use.
Some parts of the UI will refer to reports as ‘insights.’ Reports are ‘insights’ as well. Still, most of the UI will only refer to reports as ‘reports’ and not ‘insights.’ Insight is a deprecated term.
The Dialer Performance and Penetration dashboard provides an overview of outbound dialing metrics, as well as dispositions of dialed calls.

**Filters**
Date Range: A range of days that the dashboard will be covering. Preset to the last 30 days.
Account: The sub-account to be reported on.
Account ID: The ID of the account that needs to be viewed.
Product Group Type: Filters to a specific subset of product group types.
Product Group: Filters to a specific subset of product groups.
Product Type: Filters to a specific subset of product types.
Product: Filters to a specific subset of products.
Note: An activity is attributed to a time interval by its start timestamp. The account filter is a parent filter to the other filters (except for the Date). For example, if you select a particular account, the Agent Group filter will be showing only agent groups of that account.

**Dialer KPIs section**
Dialed: Count of outbound call attempts.
Hit Rate: Percentage of live answered calls to the total call attempts.

Leads Complete: Number of completed leads.
Dialer Penetration Chart: Bar chart that shows the percentage of completed calls (% Outbound Leads Complete Count, y-axis) to the number of times a call was attempted (Pass #, x-axis).
