### FTP/SFTP support

Data stored in Contact Center can be backed up via a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). You don’t require cloud storage to use FTP/SFTP. If you have cloud storage enabled on your account, you can manage file storage rules in the Life Cycle Management menu of the admin dashboard.

**How can I get FTP/SFTP?**
To set up a FTP/SFTP, you must submit a request via Nice InContact for our support team to configure FTP/SFTP for your account. Once FTP/SFTP has been configured for your account, you cannot edit the feature yourself. You must contact your sales representative to have it re-added with additional features or customizations in place.

**Where can I find the configuration form?**
You will be sent the configuration form for FTP/SFTP by your sales representative after requesting to add this feature to your account. Then the completed form will route to Nice InContact’s team to set up FTP/SFTP.

**What are their options for storage/backup?**
You may store the following files in your account:
Call recordings
Chat transcripts
Emails
Reports
Screen recordings
The amount of data you can store depends on your needs. Your sales representative will work to customize one of our plans to handle the amount of data required. You may also request a Time To Live (TTL) configuration for your files in storage. TTL defines how long files shall be stored on the server. The default setting is to never delete the files, but you could reach the maximum storage capacity as a result. 
In terms of backup, you may invest in RingCentral’s cloud storage program, which will back up your files to the cloud set up in the account. Should you decide to have a different source as your backup (i.e., not owned by Contact Center), you must create a case for our support team to handle.

**What is the cost?**
Contact Center customizes every plan we have for companies. You can find general information by looking at this page.

**How do I connect FTP/SFTP to RCArchiver?**
You will need to input a request with your sales representative to set up RingCentral Archiver as a backup option for your company data.
