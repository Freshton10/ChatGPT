### Using supervisor coaching tools

As a supervisor, you can access the supervisor dashboard, where you’ll find several coaching tools to help guide your agents through their calls and digital interactions. These tools let you monitor calls, coach agents, and barge in on calls and digital interactions.
Which channel do you want to access the tools through?
Voice
Digital

**Monitoring a call or an agent**
You can monitor a call or an agent from both the Agents or Interactions tabs.

2. Select where you want to monitor an agent or a call.
3. Click the Agents tab, hover over an agent, and go to the far right of the table. Choose this option to monitor either an agent or that agent’s active call.
4. Click the Interactions tab, hover over a call, and go to the far right of the table. Choose this option to monitor calls.
5. Click the Monitor speaker icon.
Once you start monitoring a call or agent, a small window will appear in the upper right corner.
6. When you’re done, click Stop monitoring.

**Barging in on a call**
You can barge in on or take control of a call if your agent needs assistance. You can also disconnect that agent or end the call for everyone.
