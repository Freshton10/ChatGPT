**How to enable the Directory Sync feature?**
To enable Directory Sync on your account, open a case on the support site or contact RingCentral Customer Support .
**How to restrict Directory Sync to selected RingCentral MVP extension ranges only?**
Yes. If you don’t want all RingCentral MVP extensions to appear in Contact Center agent address books you can open a case on the support site or contact RingCentral Customer Support and choose one of the options below:
Sync all extensions (default)
Sync listed extension only (provide the list to include)
Exclude listed extension from sync (provide the list to exclude)
**Corporate Directory entries not showing in my agent console’s address book**
Directory Sync feature is not enabled for your Contact Center account. Directory Sync feature requires some configuration effort and is not enabled on RingCentral Contact Center accounts by default. To enable Directory Sync on your account, open a case on the support site or contact RingCentral Customer Support .
**Corporate Directory entries not showing in my agent console’s address book (Directory Sync enabled)**
Directory Sync runs on a scheduled basis at a specified time. As a result, it may take time for address books to get in sync. Default sync is daily at 2:00 am US/Mountain Time.
**Corporate directory not showing complete list in my agent console’s address book**
Some corporate directory entries expected to be synced are unsupported. Directory Sync serves only RingCentral address book entries of certain types, namely:
User
Department
Announcement Only
Voicemail Only
Shared Lines Group.
Entries of other types (e.g. Paging Only) are not subject to sync and will hence not appear in agent console’s address books.
**Agent console’s address book not showing the changes to my RingCentral directory.**
Next scheduled sync operation hasn’t run yet.  Directory Sync runs on a scheduled basis at specified time. As a result, it may take time for address books to get in sync.
**Directory Sync Configuration section does not appear on the RingCentral Service Website**
That is expected - there’s none. To enable Directory Sync on your account, open a case on the support site or contact RingCentral Customer Support .
**My address book entries have “Unknown” presence state (grey ribbon icon).**
Presence tracking for Directory Sync is disabled on your account. Contact RingCentral Customer Support to enable presence tracking.
My address book shows an RC Office extension as Busy while it’s actually in DND mode.
Currently, DND extensions are reported as Busy, though they will retain their DND-specific behavior on call or transfer. This is a known limitation and will be eliminated in future releases.
