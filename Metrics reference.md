### Metrics reference

Metrics are computational expressions of numerical or quantitative data. These are data where mathematical functions can be performed. According to our released logical data model, we built a set of pre-defined metrics based on the available list of facts and attributes.
Based on standard metrics, you can create calculated metrics and modify standard metrics with Attribute filters.
