### Intro to supervisor for agents

The central hub for all supervisor activities is the Supervisor menu, which you can access from the left navigation bar in Engage’s agent interface.

From your dashboard, you can utilize tools to help you monitor and coach agents while interacting with customers. These tools also provide more information on an agent, the ability to “whisper” to an agent during their call, barge in on a call, or take over a digital interaction.

**Supervisor dashboard**
You can use the dashboard for real-time review of active calls, digital interactions, and agents’ performances. You can customize your dashboard to your preference.

Note: Supervisors can also see real-time reports on agents’ performances in the Analytics interface. Learn more about real-time reporting.

**Coaching tools**
To see an agent’s calls or digital interactions, supervisors can click on a single agent’s interactions count to view details about that agent. Supervisors can also use coaching tools to monitor or help the agent.
