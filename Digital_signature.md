Setting up Digital Signage using RingCentral Rooms
Last Updated: October 28, 2022
Creating dedicated Rooms for Digital Signage
Sign in to your online account.
Go to Meetings > RingCentral Video > Rooms > Rooms List.
Click Add Room.
Select Digital Signage Only under Room Type.

Enter the Room name.
If you have a multi-site setting, select a location.
Note: If you have multiple office locations, we recommend creating a Room name or naming convention that makes it easier to select specific rooms. A typical naming convention might consist of, for instance, [Office Location] - [Conference Room Name]. For example: ‘SF - Ocean Beach,’ or ‘DEN - Breckenridge.’
Enter the URL you want to display on the monitor.
Click Add.
Note: Digital Signage Only rooms are only available for RingCentral brand users using Windows devices.
