### MAX Agent training

MAX (My Agent Experience) Agent is a contact-handling web application that allows agents to interact with customers using phone calls, voicemail, email, chat, and other communication venues. MAX also supports the use of multiple contact venues at the same time. Additional features in MAX include:
Transferring calls to other agents or skills
Conferencing between the contact and another agent
Placing the contact on hold
Dispositioning and tagging the interaction for categorization
Creating reminders to reach the contact again at a later time
Utilizing the address book to quickly place call
If your company is interested in adopting MAX Agent or having new employees learn the product, you can find comprehensive training on our Contact Center training page. We provide training through RingCentral University and webinars on MAX Agent.
Should you require additional training materials, you can reach out to our RingCentral Support team for more resources.
