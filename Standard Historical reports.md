### Standard Historical reports
These reports are created by the system. They are associated with default dashboards, but you can also use them however you want.
Learn more about historical dashboards.
Not all reports are available in default dashboards. Dashboards and reports that reference digital data are reserved for future use.
Note: Some parts of the UI will refer to reports as ‘insights.’ Reports are ‘insights’ as well. Still, most of the UI will only refer to reports as ‘reports’ and not ‘insights.’ Insight is a deprecated term.
