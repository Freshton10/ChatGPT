### Understanding supervisor dashboards

As a supervisor, you can improve your agents’ performances by using analytics in the Engage Voice dashboard.
To access and customize your dashboard, open the Supervisor page from the left navigation bar.

**Agents tab**
You’ll see a list of all your team’s agents and their stats in the Agents tab.
Stats
Agent: The agent’s name.
State: The agent’s state.
State Duration: How long the agent has been in a given agent state.
Pending disposition: How long the agent takes to disposition an interaction.
Active interactions: The total number of active interactions (voice and digital).
Longest active interaction: The longest-running active interaction of an agent.
Average time per interaction: The average time to end an interaction (voice and digital).
Interactions rollup: All interactions handled in 24 hours (sum of voice, digital, and legacy chat/SMS).
Talk Time: The cumulative time the agent spends on calls in a given day.
Average time per call: The average time the agent spends on a call.
Login: The cumulative time the agent is logged in on a given day.
Skill: The skill profile the agent is currently accessing.
Utilization: The utilization rate or percentage of an agent’s engaged time over their login time (Utilization (%) = Engaged time / Login time * 100), where Engaged time is the total time an agent has at least one interaction active.

**Interactions tab**
In the Supervisor dashboard, you can click on the Interactions tab to view all active interactions for the agents you supervise.
Stats
Channel: The channel of the interaction.
Interaction duration: How long the interaction has been active.
Agent: The agent handling the interaction.
From: The caller or sender depending on the interaction type.
Voice interaction: ANI + CNAM (if available).
Digital interaction: Sender name or “Anonymous.”
Subject: The subject line of an email or the first message of a digital interaction. This stat will be blank for voice interactions.
Pending disposition: How long the agent takes to disposition an interaction.

**Configuring the supervisor dashboard**
In the left navigation bar, open the Supervisor page.
Select a tab and click the Settings icon in the top right corner. This will open the Update Columns window.

Check or uncheck the box next to each stat or metric for either the Agents or the Interactions tabs you’d like to add or remove.
Click Save.
After you save your changes, the metrics you selected will appear as columns in your dashboard.
