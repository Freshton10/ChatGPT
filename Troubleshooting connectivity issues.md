### Troubleshooting connectivity issues

Common connectivity and call quality issues include:
**Garbled audio:** Audio that sounds like you’re “underwater” or talking into a fan
**Choppy audio:** Spoken words are broken-up but still understandable
**Static:** Audio interference similar to radio static
**Cutting in and out:** Audio starts and stops, rendering speech incomprehensible
**One-way audio:** Only one participant can hear the other
**Dead air:** No audio from either participant
Common causes of connectivity and call-quality issues include:
The phone carrier might need to make a route change.
The phone carrier of a dedicated circuit might be receiving errors.
A router, switch, or private branch exchange (PBX) could be having technical problems.
The internet service protocol (ISP) might be experiencing latency, packet loss, or an outage.
**Possible resolutions:**
Identify the issue and detail the agent’s experience.
Try to reproduce the audio issue. If possible, document the steps needed to reproduce it.
Listen to call recordings to determine if the issue is present on the recordings or on the call itself.
Try to identify if the agent, the caller, or both parties are experiencing the audio issue.
Try to identify any similarities among calls with audio issues. Are the affected calls:
Associated with a specific toll-free number?
Going to a specific skill?
Going to a specific group of agents?
Going to a specific location?
Open a RingCentral Tech Support case and provide as much relevant information as you can:
What types of sound issues are you experiencing?
Has the audio ever worked as expected?
When did this issue begin?
What hardware are you using?
How many calls and/or agents are affected?
Which party on the call is experiencing the issue?
Which Contact IDs are associated with this issue?
Which type(s) of phones or equipment are failing?
Are the agents using softphones or deskphones?
Is the phone system on-site or remote?
Is the agent application responding?
Run a speed test for LAN and wired devices. Take note of upload speed, download speed, jitter, and ping.
