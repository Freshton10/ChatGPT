### Intro to ACD/IVR

Automatic Contact Distributor (ACD) allows you to configure general settings that support your interaction channels, your agents, and the way you route between the two information about skills, dispositions, points of contact, and quick replies.
An Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is an automated phone system that allows incoming callers to bypass live agents by accessing information via a voice response system of pre-recorded messages. An IVR uses touch tone keypad menus or speech recognition to route calls to specific departments or specialists. 
ACD/IVR retrieves data, such as call logs, response logs from scripts, or dispositions, using RingCentral’s Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

**What do I need to know about the required documentation for ACD/IVR?**
You may need to provide the following documents to implement ACD/IVR:
Requirements Approval Email (RAE): Provides finalized requirements documentation to customers during the implementation process.
Data Collection Workbook: The Data Collection Workbook is where requirements for Central/User Hub and Integration are documented. The Data Collection Workbook is designed to allow you to use prebuilt APIs to upload data automatically to Central/Userhub.
Visio Call Flow Templates: The designs that you can use when you create your IVR call flows. You can use these templates as starting points for creating the pre-requirement call flows that you'll present to the customer in your first requirements session.
